# Todo List App – Full Stack with Next.js

A full stack Todo List web application built as my **first independent full stack project** using Next.js. It is a CRUD **Todos** application, where users can manage their **Todos** based on the date they set.

The main goal of this project was to understand how frontend and backend logic work together in a single Next.js application, and to build a solid foundation for more complex full stack projects in the future.

## 📌 Project Background

This project was started in **January 2025** and completed in **March 2025**.

I built this project as a hands-on way to apply what I had learned about **Next.js**, including routing, server components, API routes, and database integration, while also learning how to structure a real-world full stack application.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Next.js**  
  Used for routing, server components, and API route handlers to handle both frontend and backend logic in one framework.

- **Tailwind CSS**  
  Utility-first CSS framework used to build a responsive and consistent user interface.

- **MongoDB**  
  NoSQL database used to store user accounts and todo data.

- **Mongoose (ODM)**  
  Used to define schemas, validate data, and interact with MongoDB in a structured way.

- **NextAuth.js**  
  Implemented authentication, session handling, and protected routes.

- **Framer Motion**  
  Used for small UI animations, mainly in the navigation header, to improve user experience.

## 📄 Notes

- This project was built during my early full stack learning phase
- The focus was on **understanding concepts**, not perfection
