## Todo List App with Next.js, tailwind and mongodb

First full stack project that I have made by myself (but still need help AI :), read documentation, and watching some youtube videos, but the matter is I do understand what is going indside). I made the project using following technologies and library:

- Next Js
  Of course, fullstack framework for React
- Tailwind
- MongoDB, with Mongoose ODM
- Next Auth
- framer-motion
  for a little animation in header navbar (I don't think I know how to use it well)

Learn a lot about some knowledge:

- How to use Next Js
- How to connect to MongoDB with Mongoose
- How to send data and get data to Database
