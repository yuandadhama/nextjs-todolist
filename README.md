# Todo List App – Full Stack with Next.js

A full stack Todo List web application built as my **first independent full stack project** using Next.js.  
This project represents an important learning milestone where I combined frontend, backend, authentication, and database integration into a single application.

Although the project is **not yet finished**, it is intentionally published to document my learning process and architectural understanding.

## 📌 Project Background

This project was started on **January 29, 2025**.  
Due to personal and external circumstances, I was unable to continue development at that time. However, the project is **planned to be completed** and improved in the future.

Despite its unfinished state, the core concepts and structure reflect my understanding of full stack web development.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Next.js**  
  Full stack React framework (routing, server-side logic, API routes)

- **Tailwind CSS**  
  Utility-first CSS framework for responsive and clean UI design

- **MongoDB**  
  NoSQL database for storing user and todo data

- **Mongoose (ODM)**  
  Schema-based data modeling and database interaction

- **NextAuth.js**  
  Authentication and session management

- **Framer Motion**  
  Simple animations (used mainly in the header navigation)

## ✨ Features (Current)

- User authentication
- Create and manage todo items
- Database integration with MongoDB
- Basic UI animation using Framer Motion
- Responsive layout

## 📚 What I Learned from This Project

- Building a **full stack web application** with Next.js
- Connecting and interacting with **MongoDB using Mongoose**
- Handling **server-side logic and API routes**
- Managing authentication with **NextAuth**
- Understanding data flow between frontend and backend
- Reading documentation and solving problems independently  
  (with the help of AI and learning resources)

## 🚧 Project Status

**Status:** In Progress (Paused)

This project is currently **not complete**, but it is not abandoned.  
I plan to:
- Refactor code structure
- Improve authentication flow
- Add better error handling
- Complete missing features
- Enhance UI/UX

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

- First hands-on experience building a real **full stack application**
- Strengthen understanding of backend logic and database interaction
- Practice problem-solving and self-learning
- Serve as a foundation for more advanced projects

---

## 📄 Notes

- This project was built during my early full stack learning phase
- Code quality and structure will be improved as the project evolves
- The focus was on **understanding concepts**, not perfection
